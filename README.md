# VSH-Advanced
"VSH is too restricted with boss-modifications and FF2 is too god-damn clunky." - Nergal

We hope to achieve something far more advanced and stable.

# Words from Nergal about bugs & glitches
some bugs are that sometimes it doesn't allocate the rightly chosen player to be the boss, some private forwards are not called back sometimes which I find very odd.

when a player is finished being the boss, sometimes their boss specific variables aren't reset.

There's not many bugs and glitches but they're major flaws that screw up the mod in general.

# Your viewing the Master Branch

If you was looking for the most recent bleeding edge technology, you need to click on the button that says branch: master, and change it to branch: develop

Currently VSHA is now working.
